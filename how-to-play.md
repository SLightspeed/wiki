# How to play

*中文 (中国)*: [如何游玩](how-to-play-zh-cn)

After you go to [the webpage of the game](https://ulysseszh.github.io/rpg/dododo/),
there are 3 ways in which you can start playing,
each of which starts with providing the game with a **beatmap** (or chart).

## Playing through uploading files

You need to upload a beatmap from your file system.

You can also specify an audio file for the music.
If there is no audio file specified, the game will use that specified by
[`audioUrl`](beatmap-spec#audiourl) in the [head](how-to-beatmap#head) of the beatmap.

In the [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/977458815794552842/977481204536311838),
you can find many beatmap files
(it is the temporary location to publish beatmaps until the beatmap store is developed).

## Playing through browsing the store

The function is *under development*.

There will be a store (under development) for beatmappers to publish their beatmaps.

## Playing through selecting from history

The function is *under development*.
