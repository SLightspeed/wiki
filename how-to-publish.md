# How to publish a beatmap

*中文 (中国)*: [如何发布谱面](how-to-publish-zh-cn)

Currently, the only official way of publishing a beatmap is to publish it in
[the Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/977458815794552842/977481204536311838)
([join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/yYdMw5hm2K) first to get access to the channel).

After the offical store of Dododo beatmaps is developed, beatmappers can publish beatmaps there.

Alternatively, beatmappers can publish their beatmaps on their own
(in any ways letting people download the beatmap files).
